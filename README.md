# CoinFlip2

Make the following changes to the CoinFlip2.

Use two boolean variables instead of one. The second variable will store the outcome of the coin flip.

If the user fails to enter heads or
tails have the program prompt the user to re enter the input.
The program will repeat the prompt as often as neccessary until the user enters either heads or tails.
